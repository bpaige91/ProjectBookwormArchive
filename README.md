# ProjectBookwormArchive
Project Description:
An application that provides a framework for the user to keep a digital record of their book collection. Given an ISBN or book title, it can pull details about the book, publisher, and author into a short summary and provide a review from the NYTimes. The userâ€™s ISBNs are stored locally, so that they can close or refresh the page and still have their information saved.
