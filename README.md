# ProjectBookwormArchive

## Project Description:
An application that provides a framework for the user to keep a digital record of their book collection. Given an ISBN or book title, it can pull details about the book, publisher, and author into a short summary and provide a review from the NYTimes. The userâ€™s ISBNs are stored locally, so that they can close or refresh the page and still have their information saved.

## Instructions:
To use the application:
Find the ISBN of the book you would like to search (it will be listed on the back or inside cover of a physical book)
Type the ISBN into the search bar in the top right and click 'submit'
Observe results! 
Your search history will be saved and displayed when you search a new volume or upon reloading the page.
